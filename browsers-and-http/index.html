  <!--
    This code describes a form with two fields: a small one asking
    for a name and a larger one to write a message in. 
    
    When you click the Send button, the information in those fields will be
    encoded into a query string. 
    
    When the <form> elementâ€™s method attribute is GET (or is omitted), 
    that query string is tacked onto the action URL, and the browser 
    makes a GET request to that URL.

    GET /example/message.html?name=Jean&message=Yes%3F HTTP/1.1 
    
    The start of a query string is indicated by a question mark. 
    
    After that follow pairs of names and values, corresponding to the
    name attribute on the form field elements and the content of
    those elements, respectively. 
    
    An ampersand character (&) is used to separate the pairs.

    The actual message encoded in the previous URL is "Yes?", even
    though the question mark is replaced by a strange code. 
    
    Some characters in query strings must be escaped. The question mark,
    represented as %3F, is one of those. 
    
    There seems to be an unwritten rule that every format needs its own way of escaping
    characters. This one, called URL encoding, uses a percent sign
    followed by two hexadecimal digits that encode the character
    code. In this case, 3F, which is 63 in decimal notation, is the
    code of a question mark character.
